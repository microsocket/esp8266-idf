# Espressif IoT Development Framework

ESP8266-IDF is the unofficial development framework for the **ESP8266** SoC provided for Linux

### Non-GitHub forks

ESP-IDF uses relative locations as its submodules URLs ([.gitmodules](.gitmodules)). So they link to GitHub.
If ESP-IDF is forked to a Git repository which is not on GitHub, you will need to run the script
[tools/set-submodules-to-github.sh](tools/set-submodules-to-github.sh) after git clone.
The script sets absolute URLs for all submodules, allowing `git submodule update --init --recursive` to complete.
If cloning ESP-IDF from GitHub, this step is not needed.

# Quick Reference

See the Getting Started guide links above for a detailed setup guide. This is a quick reference for common commands when working with ESP-IDF projects:

## Setup Build Environment

(See the Getting Started guide listed above for a full list of required steps with more details.)

* Install host build dependencies mentioned in the Getting Started guide.
* Run the install script to set up the build environment. The options include `install.bat` or `install.ps1` for Windows, and `install.sh` or `install.fish` for Unix shells.
* Run the export script on Windows (`export.bat`) or source it on Unix (`source export.sh`) in every shell environment before using ESP-IDF.

## Configuring the Project

* `idf.py set-target <chip_name>` sets the target of the project to `<chip_name>`. Run `idf.py set-target` without any arguments to see a list of supported targets.
* `idf.py menuconfig` opens a text-based configuration menu where you can configure the project.

## Compiling the Project

`idf.py build`

... will compile app, bootloader and generate a partition table based on the config.

## Flashing the Project

When the build finishes, it will print a command line to use esptool.py to flash the chip. However you can also do this automatically by running:

`idf.py -p PORT flash`

Replace PORT with the name of your serial port (like `COM3` on Windows, `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux, or `/dev/cu.usbserial-X` on MacOS. If the `-p` option is left out, `idf.py flash` will try to flash the first available serial port.

This will flash the entire project (app, bootloader and partition table) to a new chip. The settings for serial port flashing can be configured with `idf.py menuconfig`.

You don't need to run `idf.py build` before running `idf.py flash`, `idf.py flash` will automatically rebuild anything which needs it.

## Viewing Serial Output

The `idf.py monitor` target uses the [idf_monitor tool](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/idf-monitor.html) to display serial output from ESP32 or ESP32-S Series SoCs. idf_monitor also has a range of features to decode crash output and interact with the device. [Check the documentation page for details](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/idf-monitor.html).

Exit the monitor by typing Ctrl-].

To build, flash and monitor output in one pass, you can run:

`idf.py flash monitor`

## Compiling & Flashing Only the App

After the initial flash, you may just want to build and flash just your app, not the bootloader and partition table:

* `idf.py app` - build just the app.
* `idf.py app-flash` - flash just the app.

`idf.py app-flash` will automatically rebuild the app if any source files have changed.

(In normal development there's no downside to reflashing the bootloader and partition table each time, if they haven't changed.)

## Erasing Flash

The `idf.py flash` target does not erase the entire flash contents. However it is sometimes useful to set the device back to a totally erased state, particularly when making partition table changes or OTA app updates. To erase the entire flash, run `idf.py erase_flash`.

This can be combined with other targets, ie `idf.py -p PORT erase_flash flash` will erase everything and then re-flash the new app, bootloader and partition table.
